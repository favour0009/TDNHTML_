        <h1>WHY WAS THIS LIBRARY PUT UP</h1>
        <p>Good day everyone,my name is Nwachukwu Favour and i am the founder of this online library. <br>
        This Library was established for the sole purpose of learning. <br>
        Growing up i attended a public school and we were either lacking teachers or lacking textbooks. <br>
        Worst of it all we didn't have a library and this might have discouraged a lot people from reading back in my schooling days. <br>
        That was when i vowed to ensure that no one lacked the educational resources needed to learn. <br>
        And growing up I loved reading,it was either poetry or drama with me. <br>
        But the lack of text books really disturbed me due to the that i was in science class and my parents lacked the sufficient funds to buy them.</p>
        <h1>HOW THIS LIBRARY WORKS</h1>
         <p>The main function of this library is to ensure everyone learns. <br>
        So therefore, this website was put up to be an interactive learningenvironment. <br>
        We know no one is an island of knowledge so this website is one where you can come to share textbooks on various subjects and you can ask questions. <br>
        I assure you  someone be online to answer you.</p>
        <p>Thank you and let the learning commence.</p>
